no shell function present in the file

shows us a pointer somewhere in the stack
creates a char[32] buffer
reads 512 bytes into it (Overflow)
does weird metal shit then exits

we can infer that the binary has protection mechanisms and the pointer is there to help us bypass them
the name suggests we need to use gadgets to ROP into a shellcode
but how ?
