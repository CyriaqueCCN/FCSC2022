Argh, throwbacks from high school logic class.

We have a schema with logic gates and we are asked about the output with a given input.

Gates to the left are AND, gates to the right are XOR

The little dot in the bottom input of each AND is a NOT

We write a little C script to solve it because we're lazy.
